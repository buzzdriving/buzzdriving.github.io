What We Do
----------

### Flexible lessons
We tailor our lessons to suit your requirements. Lessons can be scheduled at a flexible time and place. We offer lessons of one, one and a half and two hours in length. Block booking discounts available.

### Theory test
In order to apply for your practical test a theory test must be taken and passed. Help is provided to prepare you for this test.

### Mock tests
When it gets close to your test we will conduct a mock test which will be one of the test routes and will be done in a very similar way to the real thing. This will help prepare you for the big day and give you an insight to what your test will be like. The mock test also highlights any areas that still need to be worked on.

### Pass plus courses
Pass plus is a scheme designed by the DSA to help lower the chances of newly qualified drivers being involved in an accident. This is a six hour course of lessons including motorway driving with no test at the end. It helps develop greater awareness and anticipation and builds on existing skills. On completing the course you will receive a certificate and may be entitled to cheaper car insurance.

### Motorway and refresher lessons
If after your test you feel you would like to gain more experience on the road or driving on the motorway then we will offer additional lessons to build your confidence.
